# G3: Low-Fidelity Prototype

## Part A: Description

We created two low-fidelity prototypes to assess the viability of our solution. The first focused on validating the primary social goal of connecting listers and tenants through enhanced post organization. It took the form of a Google Sheet with pages for both listing and potential tenant posts, presenting information in a clear and organized format. Testers were presented with two scenarios: one where they were looking for housing based on specific criteria and another where they acted as listers in search of potential tenants. In both cases, a filtering/search row at the top of the sheet allowed them to refine their preferences. Acting as "wizards of Oz," we manually filtered the sheet on a separate computer to display only the posts meeting their criteria. The second low-fidelity prototype involved a sketch of our home page. After showing them the design, we sought to understand the types of personalizations they wanted to see and be able to make in posts.

## User Testing Report

*What were your goals with this wizard of oz session: what did you want to learn and measure?*

*What did you learn in the wizard of oz session?*

*Are the findings promising enough that you would like to go ahead with the project? (If yes, describe why, if no, describe what changes you are proposing to make.) @Thevina Dokka*

*What elements will you keep in your next iteration of the design?*

*What elements do you need to revise? Why?*

Our goals for this wizard of oz session were to (1) see if our platform successfully facilitated connection between lister and tenant, (2) understand how easy our proposed platform would be to use, and (3) identify any potential pain points or additional features that users would want. We used Google Sheets to set up a functional prototype where both listers and tenants can make posts, search for posts, and filter by different parameters. Additionally, we made sketches to replicate what our UI might look like to investigate what personalizations our users would want.

We made several key observations in our wizard of oz session, outlined below:

- **Generally, users want more housing details to filter by, but also don’t want to feel overwhelmed with too many filters.** We included a lot of filterable options in our prototype, such as filtering by number of roommates, shared versus private bedroom and bathroom, roommate gender, and more; some of the additional filters that users requested included furnished versus unfurnished, official relet versus unofficial sublease, and more. Generally, although users want to be able to filter by many things, they brought up the issue of having an overwhelming amount of features, so we need to find a balance between enough filters that users can narrow in on properties that are actually relevant to them without having too many filters that simply overwhelm users. Our users also suggested having a “property features” section for each listing where interested tenants can easily find all of the details of the property (such as pets, roommates, etc.)

- **Tenant users want clearly defined next steps if they are interested in a listing.** For example, a listing might state that if a tenant is interested, the next steps would be to (1) reach out to the lister via email, (2) conduct a virtual tour of the residence via Zoom, (3) conduct a background check of the lister, and (4) proceed with signing the sublease contract. Users specified a desire to have these steps clearly outlined for each listing post so they can understand what all needs to be done to finalize the sublease. 

- **Tenants want to be able to distinguish between hard requirements and soft requirements when searching for properties.** For example, a tenant might require their own bedroom, they may prefer their own bathroom but be open to sharing. For this tenant, when they search properties, they only want to be shown properties that have a private bedroom available, but want to be shown both private and shared bathroom properties (with private bathroom properties being displayed higher in their search result, since this is their preference).

- **Tenants want to be sure that all of the listings that they are viewing are real and not scams.** This is something we already discussed prior to the prototype session, but our users gave some novel ideas for giving tenants peace of mind that the property is legitimate (e.g., requiring that photos are uploaded with each listing post, or making each post personalizable with colors and patterns, so more personalized posts seem more legitimate).  ** **

While we did receive several points of feedback and additional ideas, our testers believed this platform could be highly effective overall. Overall we felt the session met our three goals and validated our approach, thus supporting that we move forward with our project idea. Leveraging our learnings, our revisions and expansions will include:

- **Filtering that is intentionally and carefully designed.** The filtering fields included, types of filters, and organization of them should be crafted to create the most user-friendly experience. We should keep but expand on our existing list of filters and research different interfaces for presenting them. If time allows, we should learn how to implement priority to our filters.

- **Beyond fields to filter on, posts that contain helpful information for the subleasing process.** While we included contact information in posts, we should expand on this by providing next steps for connecting as well as more information about the poster. Incorporating user visibility is a feature that Facebook offers through profiles and one of the reasons it is a popular choice for finding listings. If user profiles fall outside of our scope, we could explore workarounds such as creating stub profiles or linking to social media. Beyond helpfulness, testers mentioned that concrete next steps and user visibility contribute to a sense of authenticity in posts.

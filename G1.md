# User Research Report
## Introduction

With the lack of platforms available that are efficient in connecting individuals looking to sublease spaces to those who are looking to rent, and current platforms being used for this purpose being inadequate and insufficient to fully support this need, we want to develop a platform with features that support the pain points and needs of users. Our primary target audiences are individuals who have residences and are looking to sublease or relet, and collectively, individuals looking to lease an apartment or resident area. These areas are solely restricted to the larger Seattle region, and would be focused towards single rooms or apartments for lease rather than larger spaces.

## Methods

We conducted semi-structured interviews and utilized questionnaires to better understand our target users, their goals and needs, and the housing environment in the Seattle area as a whole. We chose these techniques because we wanted to narrow in on people who have tried (both successfully and unsuccessfully) to sublease or relet their residences, or to be a subletting tenant. Our goal was to understand how these people attempted to navigate the sublease process; including what methods they used, how successful these methods were, and what their pain points were. We also wanted to understand if people would find a subleasing platform useful, and if so, what features they would expect in order for this platform to be more useful than the baseline solutions (such as Facebook groups and word of mouth).

Our eventual participants included two individuals who had previously subleased their residence in the Seattle area to someone else, and three individuals who had been tenants of subleases. We utilized a mix of semi-structured interviews and questionnaires among these participants to learn more about their experiences and pain points.

## Findings

### Activities & Users

There are two types of individuals that this platform would pertain to: listers and tenants. 

#### Listers
Listers are people who want to lease their current housing to another person for a period of time shorter than their full lease. The main activities they partake in are listing a sublease for their housing, looking for tenants, and identifying one who meets their requirements and they would feel comfortable leasing too. Additionally, they would manage any scheduled tours or inspections and communicate with interested, potential, and already signed tenants.

#### Tenants
Individuals looking to sublease housing. They search for listings that meet their preferred requirements for rent, availability, roommates, etc. Additionally, they contact and communicate with listers and schedule preliminary visits or tours. Some tenants post information about themselves and what they are looking for in a sublease.

### Environments

There are several virtual environments that are currently being used to facilitate this service. These include Facebook groups, Sublet.com, Kopa, Yammer, and Zillow (though this is more for longer-term listings). Additionally, there are sites for interaction within more closed groups that are united based on culture, race, age, profession, area, and interests. In regards to the specific Facebook groups for UW and UW associated individuals, there is a public “UW Housing, Subleases, Roommates, Apartments” group and a corresponding private group. There are more informal means such as word of mouth and referrals through peers that individuals make use of as well.

There is also the physical environment of the housing being listed. This is where activities like tours or meetings often take place.

### Interactions

After a lister or tenant makes a post, others will either direct message or comment on the post to express interest. When a lister and tenant align on both interest and availability they continue to interact. Often, the tenant will enquire for more information about the housing and lease. Depending on the specific lister and tenant, they might arrange a tour or meeting. After the sublease is finalized, the degree of interaction varies. Logistics must be coordinated for basic activities such as handing off keys as well as paying rent and utilities. If issues arise before, during, or after the sublease, the lister and tenant may need to interact to resolve them.

In Facebook groups, it's not uncommon for spam comments to be made on posts, as seen above. These interactions are typically one way, unless the lister engages.

### Objects

Across all virtual environments the central objects are posts. Typically, these are made by listers but, as mentioned, sometimes tenants will make posts as well. All of the environments have slightly different ways of managing and organizing posts.

Within the physical environment, the objects are the individual rooms, apartments or other housing being subleased.

## Takeaways

We identified several key takeaways from our user research, outlined below.

### Spam and bots

We found that most participants who had engaged with Facebook groups for subleasing (both UW-specific groups and Seattle area groups) struggled with spam and bots in these groups. This was identified as a key pain point for both listers and tenants, and no solution was identified other than ignoring the spam.

### Filtering

We found that both listers and tenants wanted better solutions for filtering when engaging in the subleasing process. Listers wanted their interested tenants to be filtered so that they would not receive inquiries from people who didn’t meet their requirements (e.g., inquiries from couples when they advertise their room for a single person), and tenants wanted to be able to easily search for properties with their specified requirements rather than manually scrolling through many posts to find what they were looking for.

### Feeling Rushed

Both listers and tenants identified feeling rushed as a primary pain point in the subleasing process. Listers discussed feeling like if they didn’t act right away, an interested tenant would choose other housing and would lose out; tenants discussed feeling like if they didn't act right away, the lister would choose to sublease the residence to someone else.

### Need for Better Communication

Listers and tenants both listed wanting better communication in future subleasing experiences. Our lister and tenant participants explained that they used various non-formal means of communication when communicating with each other, such as Messenger or WeChat, and expressed a desire for more formal means of communication, such as a portal.

# Welcome gto DubLease!

## Background

Last year, we tried to sublease our apartments and went through the typical process that most people at UW go through. We posted in the Facebook groups and even tried some of the other platforms where people advertise housing (such as Yammer). However, this process was super annoying. When we posted, we got no responses, and we weren’t sure if anyone even saw our posts. Also, there was SO MUCH spam from bots in this group. We realized that there is a lack of a dedicated service that exists solely for connecting listings and tenants. We’d like to introduce you to DubLease! 
DubLease is a platform that connects listers looking to find suitable tenants for their available residential areas to individuals looking for a safe and accommodating place that meets their needs. On DubLease you can create listings as a lister and filter/sort listings as a tenant, all within the local Seattle area. Users are present with only relevant information particular to the post and can choose how they would like to pursue potential opportunities. Fun prompts and questions also help to create a more personalized experience that comforts the user knowing that they are presented with credible information and having safe interactions with trusting individuals

## Architectural Design

### Identifying the Different Subsystems and their Interactions

The three subsystems of our project are the frontend (broken up into the webpage for listings posts and the webpage for tenant posts), backend (broken up into API endpoints and functions), and SQL database (broken up into tables). The interactions of these subsystems are outlined below:

- **Making a listing post. **When a user makes a listing post, they create and submit the post via our frontend UI. After they click the button to make the post in the UI, the frontend needs to call the backend, and the backend needs to interact with the database in order to save the post. This is necessary so that this post can then be visible to everyone visiting our site. 

- **Searching the listing posts. **A user uses the filters in the frontend to search through the listing posts; once they make this search, the frontend must call the backend and the backend must call the database in order to query the listing posts and return the right results for the search query. 

- **Making a tenant post. **When a user makes a tenant post, they create and submit the post via our frontend UI. After they click the button to make the post in the UI, the frontend needs to call the backend, and the backend needs to interact with the database in order to save the post. This is necessary so that this post can then be visible to everyone visiting our site. 

- **Searching the tenant posts. **A user uses the filters in the frontend to search through the tenant posts; once they make this search, the frontend must call the backend and the backend must call the database in order to query the tenant posts and return the right results for the search query. 

- **Creating an account (secondary). **When a user creates an account via the UI, the frontend needs to call the backend and the backend needs to interact with the database in order to save the new user credentials. 

- **Saving a listing post (secondary). **When a user saves a listing post via the UI, the frontend needs to call the backend and the backend needs to interact with the database in order to save the post for the user.

- **Saving a tenant post (secondary). **When a user saves a tenant post via the UI, the frontend needs to call the backend and the backend needs to interact with the database in order to save the post for the user.

- **Deleting a post (secondary). **When a user deletes a post via the UI, the frontend needs to call the backend and the backend needs to interact with the database in order to delete the post.

### Components Required for Each Subsystem

Frontend:

- Listing posts page

- Tenant posts page

Backend:

- make_listing_post endpoint

- search_listing_posts endpoint

- make_tenant_post endpoint

- search_tenant_posts endpoint

Database:

- ListingPosts table

- TenantPosts table

### Figure Description

Our figure shows how our system and its three subsystems (frontend, backend, and database) will interact in order to meet our primary requirements. It shows that the frontend contains two components, a page for listing posts and a page for tenant posts; our backend contains four components, which are its four endpoints; and our database contains two components, which are the two tables. From the frontend UI, there are four actions that a user can take on the two UI pages: they can create a listing post, search listing posts, create a tenant post, and search tenant posts. These actions are shown via the arrows in the figure. The arrows show how information flows when these actions are taken, between the frontend, backend API endpoints, and database.

## Explanation

From the perspective of a user viewing tenant posts, sublisters are able to view all the tenant posts, with the data for each stored in our backend database of tenant posts and render on the UI for the sublister to view. The three main API methods we are defining to interact with the database will help to support all functional requirements listed and displayed in our story boards. More specifically, the methods we will define are makePost, which allows a user to create a tenant post, deletePost, which allows a user to delete a post they created, searchFilter, which will filter and display posts based on the selected filter(s). Finally, we intend for our sort functionality to be a rearrangement of currently displayed posts, the operations for which will be done on the frontEnd before rendering. Additionally, since the ways a user can engage with listings are very similar to how they interact with tenant posts (with different only in the fields and content of the posts and listings itself), we can define the same API methods for creating, deleting, and filtering through listing as well (with the API method taking in a different object type instead â€“ a list instead of a post).
